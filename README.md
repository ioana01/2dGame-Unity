# 2dGame-Unity

In this 2d game the player controls an object by pressing the A, W, S, D keys. The purpose of this game is to avoid collisions with the boxes that are being spawned at the top of the screen. The player has 3 lives. A live is lost with every collision. The game has also a menu with the buttons Play, Options and Quit. In the Options section a slider can be found to controll the volume of the background music. After the game is over a "Back" button appears on the screen, which redirects us to the main menu
